# OGIP — Status

_Last updated: 2026-07-17_

## Current phase

**M0 — walking skeleton: ✅ SHIPPED.** RAWG → raw Parquet (**dlt**) → **SQLMesh** (raw→stg→core→fs,
compiled from Bruin spec) → ML-ready `games.parquet` + `market_features.parquet` → demo notebook,
all driven by a **Prefect** flow (ephemeral, no Docker). `make check` green; **e2e test runs the
Prefect job in CI**; CI green (7/7). Repo: [github.com/dataengy/ogip](https://github.com/dataengy/ogip).
Detail: [tasks/m0-walking-skeleton.md](tasks/m0-walking-skeleton.md).

Phase 0 (scaffold) also ✅ shipped — [tasks/phase-0-scaffold.md](tasks/phase-0-scaffold.md).

**Reprioritized 2026-07-17** (SWOT against the target use-case brief):
**P1 — resilient scraping slice** ([tasks/scraping-resilient.md](tasks/scraping-resilient.md),
lane `ingestion`, [ADR-0014](../docs/adr/ADR-0014-resilient-scraping-concurrency.md)) ·
**P1 — finalize R2 + VPS deploy** ([tasks/r2-vps-finalize.md](tasks/r2-vps-finalize.md) —
every remaining item sits in lane `core-pipeline`) · **P2 — sources backlog**
([tasks/sources-backlog.md](tasks/sources-backlog.md)). M1–M4 toolset replication is demoted
below the P1s. Open requirement questions (scraping · volumes · serving/FS/semantic ·
SQL+Python): [docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md](../docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md).

## Parallel-session lanes (claim a lock before writing!)

Work is split across concurrent agent sessions. **Claim your lane** with an object lock before
writing, and settle-check first (`git fetch` + `agent-lock check`):

```bash
bash ~/.ai/skills/_scripts/session/agent-session-lock.sh acquire --repo . --object <lane> --reason "..."
```

| Lane (lock object) | Scope | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| `core-pipeline` | `spec/` `src/ogip/` `transform/` `pipelines/` `config/` `.ci/` | parallel session — M1 alt profiles; **lock STALE since 16:00** (see lock audit below); also owns every `r2-vps-finalize` item |
| `ingestion` | `ingestion/` (sources registry, connectors, raw landing) — **carved out of `core-pipeline` 2026-07-17** | parallel session (live) — home of the **P1 scraping slice** |
| `obs` | `deploy/obs/`, `src/scripts/obs-*.sh`, `docs/architecture/observability.md` | **parallel session** — Phase 7 stack shipped; 2 handoffs below |
| `evidence` | `experimental/bi/evidence/` | parallel session |
| `dagster` | `experimental/orchestration/dagster*`, `prefect-dagster-dlt-dbt` profile | parallel session |
| `vps` | `deploy/vps/`, `vps-*` recipes, `config/config.yml → deploy.vps.*` | **parallel session** — tooling shipped; 1 handoff below |
| `s3` | MinIO in `deploy/`, `storage` config, dlt/duckdb S3 destination | parallel session |
| `alerting` | `src/ogip/alerting/`, `src/tests/unit/test_alerting.py` | **parallel session** — Notifier + tg/mm/slack shipped ([#11](https://github.com/dataengy/ogip/issues/11)); 1 handoff below |

Use the **direct script**, not `just -f … agent-lock` — its recipe re-parses `--reason` through
`bash -c`, so parentheses break it.

**Lock audit 2026-07-17 ~21:00.** `core-pipeline` and `dagster` locks are **STALE** (TTL
expired 16:00 / 16:36; the holder session runs from outside this repo and both lanes belong
to it) — `break` and re-acquire before touching those lanes, and note `ingestion/` no longer
belongs to `core-pipeline`'s scope. The `ingestion` lock is also past TTL but its session is
**live** — coordinate, don't steal. Holder details (session ids, resume commands): local
`.ai/.locks/*/owner.env` (gitignored).

### Handoffs: lane `obs` → lane `core-pipeline`

The Phase 7 stack is live (`make obs-up`), but its pipeline-facing half sits in **your** lane —
`config/` and `pipelines/` are locked to you, so the obs session did not touch them:

1. **The flow writes no log file** → Alloy tails an empty dir, log panels stay blank.
   `pipelines/flows/main.py:78` calls a bare `setup_logging()`; `src/ogip/config.py` already
   exposes both knobs it needs —
   `setup_logging(json_logs=settings.log_json, log_file=settings.log_file)`.
   Parsed Loki labels additionally need `platform.log_json: true` in `config/config.yml`.
2. **Obs ports never reach `.env`** → `config/config.yml` declares `victoriametrics_port`,
   `loki_port`, `grafana_port`, but `config/.env-render.py` → `_derived()` does not map them, so
   compose falls back to literals that duplicate the SSoT. Three lines close it.

Optional later: export OTLP metrics to `localhost:4318` (prefix `ogip_`) — Alloy already
receives them and the dashboard panel is waiting. Detail:
[docs/architecture/observability.md](../docs/architecture/observability.md) → "Not wired yet".

### Handoff: lane `alerting` → lane `core-pipeline`

`src/ogip/alerting/` ships the `Notifier` + Telegram/Mattermost/Slack ([#11](https://github.com/dataengy/ogip/issues/11),
[tasks/alerting.md](tasks/alerting.md)) — verified against the live Telegram API. New files only;
nothing of yours was edited. One thing is deliberately off-SSoT and needs you:

- **Routing lives in env vars, not `config/config.yml`** — because that file and
  `config/.env-render.py` are yours. To close it: add an `alerting:` section (`backend`,
  `fallback_backend`, `dry_run`), map it in `_derived()`, add the secret slots
  (`OGIP_TG_BOT_TOKEN`, `OGIP_MM_TOKEN`, `OGIP_MM_WEBHOOK_URL`, `OGIP_SLACK_TOKEN`,
  `OGIP_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`), then swap the literal defaults in `alerting/settings.py` for
  `_yaml("alerting", …)`. The env names are already `OGIP_`-prefixed, so no namespace clash.

~~Also yours when you want alerts to actually fire: `pipelines/flows/` has no failure hook.~~
**Done 2026-07-18** (lane was FREE, held core-pipeline briefly): `pipelines/alerting_hooks.py`
→ `notify_flow_failure` wired as `on_failure=[…]` on the flow. Verified by running — Prefect
fires it on a real failure and it builds `🔴 OGIP flow failed: <flow> / run: <run> / state:
<exception>`. Silent without creds (`make_notifier()` is `None`), never raises. Still SSoT-open:
the routing-in-env-vars item above is unchanged.

### Handoff: lane `hygiene` → lane `core-pipeline`

`src/scripts/public-hygiene.sh` refuses to publish another org's identifiers (tracker ids,
internal hosts, private checkout paths, org/bot names) — the half of a leak gitleaks does not
cover, since these are not secret, only not-ours. It exists because an agent file in this repo
leaked a private path to a public commit despite a hand grep. New file, exercised (5/5 marker
patterns unit-checked, and it caught the real leak, now fixed). It is not yet a gate — to wire
it (both are your lane):

1. **CI**: add `.ci/steps/public-hygiene.sh` (one line: `source _common.sh; exec bash
   "$REPO_ROOT/src/scripts/public-hygiene.sh"`) and append `public-hygiene` to the step list in
   `.ci/run.sh` and to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
2. **prek**: add a local hook to `config/.pre-commit-config.yaml`
   (`entry: bash src/scripts/public-hygiene.sh`, `language: system`, `pass_filenames: false`).

Marker list is literal inside the script rather than in `config/config.yml` for the same reason
as alerting — `config/` is yours. Fold it into the SSoT if you prefer it centralized.

### Handoff: lane `vps` → lane `core-pipeline`

`deploy/vps/` is complete and verified ([tasks/vps-deploy-tooling.md](tasks/vps-deploy-tooling.md)),
but a real deploy still stops at preflight on one missing artifact in **your** lane:

- **`integrations/prefect/deploy.py` does not exist** → `just prefect-deploy` and `deploy.sh`
  step 5 have nothing to call. (`deploy/docker-compose.yml`, the other prerequisite, landed
  with the obs/compose lane on 2026-07-17.)

`deploy.sh` preflights and refuses to start rather than half-deploying, so this is a clean
block, not a landmine. Nothing else in `deploy/vps/` needs you: settings are read straight from
`config/config.yml → deploy.vps.*` via `yq`, so `config/.env-render.py` needed **no** change.

**The decision `deploy.py` carries (not just a missing file — flagged from the vps lane, 2026-07-18):**
Writing it means choosing a Prefect **run model**, and the repo currently under-specifies it —
worth resolving before you write, because the choice reaches into the compose lane too.

- `deploy.sh` step 5 is a **one-shot** (`uv run python integrations/prefect/deploy.py`), so
  `deploy.py` must **register a deployment and return** — `flow.serve()` blocks forever and
  would hang the deploy step. Register, don't serve.
- The compose stack (`deploy/docker-compose.yml`) runs a **Prefect server but no worker**, and
  `pipelines/flows/main.py` documents the flow as *"runs ephemerally (no server needed)"* —
  those two facts contradict, so the intended runtime isn't yet pinned. Prefect 3.7.8.
- Two coherent resolutions:
  - **serve()-based** (vps lane's recommendation — simplest, self-contained): `deploy.py`
    creates a scheduled deployment and a **separate** long-lived `flow.serve(cron=…)` process
    runs as one compose/systemd service. No work pool, no worker. Fewest moving parts; the
    server stays UI-only. Matches "no extra infra".
  - **worker + work-pool** (more scale, more parts): `deploy.py` does `flow.deploy(work_pool_name=…)`
    against the server, and a **new `prefect-worker` service** is added to compose (that half is
    the compose lane's). Only pick this if horizontal execution is actually wanted.
- Either way this is **~1 file + 1 compose service**, not just `deploy.py` alone — the worker/
  serve process is what actually executes runs; `deploy.py` on its own registers a deployment
  that nothing would pick up. Confirm the model, then the file is small.

### Handoff: lane `s3` → lane `core-pipeline`

Object storage is shipped and verified ([tasks/s3-object-storage.md](tasks/s3-object-storage.md)):
`src/ogip/storage.py` resolves backend → bucket URL + credentials, `make storage-up` runs MinIO,
and a round-trip test proves dlt → `s3://` → DuckDB-over-`httpfs` for real. But **every call site
is in your lane**, so `local` is still the only backend the pipeline actually runs on. Nothing
below changes current behaviour — `local` stays the default until you land it.

1. **`ingestion/base/base_source.py:48`** hardcodes the local FS →
   `destination=dlt_filesystem_destination(data_dir)` (from `ogip.storage`). `run()` then returns
   the dataset **URL** (`str`, not `Path`); its only caller (`pipelines/flows/main.py:41`) already
   does `str(out)`, so the flow and its asset key are unaffected.
2. **`spec/sql/raw/*.sql` + the spec compiler** — ⚠️ **the real blocker.** Layer-0 hardcodes
   `read_parquet('.run/data/raw/rawg__games/*.parquet')`, so SQLMesh keeps reading the local FS
   no matter what dlt writes to `s3://`. The lake root must be **injected by the compiler**
   (D0/D5) rather than being a literal; `ogip.storage.raw_bucket_url()` returns exactly the
   prefix it needs.
3. **`transform/sqlmesh/config.yaml`** — config, not code: SQLMesh's `DuckDBConnectionConfig`
   supports both `extensions: [httpfs]` and `secrets:`, interpolated from the `OGIP_S3_*` slots.
   SQLMesh opens its own connection, so our `configure_duckdb_s3()` cannot reach it.
4. **`config/.env-render.py`** — add `MINIO_ROOT_USER` / `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD` plus matching
   `OGIP_S3_*` dev defaults to `DEMO_DEFAULTS` (the existing `OGIP_PG_PASSWORD` pattern), so
   `make storage-up` + `backend: minio` works from a bare checkout without hand-filling slots.

`src/ogip/warehouse.py` needs **nothing**: `export_table` reads the built warehouse, never `s3://`.

## Known-broken references

- `just prefect-deploy` / `prefect-run` → `integrations/prefect/{deploy,trigger}.py` — **missing**
  (core-pipeline lane; `integrations/` does not exist yet). `deploy/vps/smoke.sh` calls `trigger.py`.
- ~~`just tasks-sync` → `integrations/github/tasks_sync.py`~~ — **fixed** 2026-07-17: rewritten as
  `src/scripts/tasks_sync.py` (pyright-covered, unlike `integrations/`). Tracker is live:
  [issues #1–#3](https://github.com/dataengy/ogip/issues).

## Decisions locked

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| D0 | `spec/sql` in **Bruin asset format**; other spec entities in Bruin where possible; contracts in **ODCS**. Open authoring serialization, not a prod dependency. |
| D1 | dbt/SQLMesh/Bruin + orchestration profiles are **runnable** demos (in `experimental/`). |
| D2 | Storage: **local FS default** + **Cloudflare R2** (cloud of record) + **MinIO** + **S3** profiles. |
| D3 | Prefect **both** ephemeral (default) + server-in-compose profile. |
| D4 | Fast slice: Phases 0–6 on **Steam + RAWG** → end-to-end demo. |
| D5 | **Default transform engine = SQLMesh** (from spec, on DuckDB, orchestrated by Prefect); plain-SQL/dbt/Bruin = comparisons; needs the spec compiler. |
| D6 | Add **FS (Feature Store) layer** `fs_*` (SQL-as-FS → parquet) + adoption analysis of a dedicated FS tool. |
| D7 | **JupyterLab** + `notebooks/` demo notebooks (primary DS interface). |
| D8 | **Evidence** optional visualizer research for DA/DS/MLE. |
| D9 | Full stack wired: typed Python · uv · Prefect 3 · **PostgreSQL** (landing + platform_meta + Prefect) · **Cloudflare R2** · **Parquet/PyArrow** · DuckDB · **manual VPS deploy** (DevOps separate) · GitHub Actions (typecheck + tests). |
| D10 | **Secrets = minimal & lightest**: gitignored **`.env`** (slots from SSoT) locally+VPS + **GitHub Actions secrets** in CI. No vault/GPG by default; Bitwarden CLI & git-secret opt-in (documented). |
| D11 | **Ingestion: dlt default** (via `BaseSource`); **ingestr optional (CDC)**; scraped/parsed data lands in **PostgreSQL `landing`**, then dlt/ingestr load it to raw Parquet. |
| D12 | **Task tracking = GitHub Issues/Projects**: `.ai/tasks/` ↔ Issues/board via `just tasks-sync`; `.ai/TODO.md` = short ordered checklist referencing tasks. |
| D13 | **Add AM (Activity Model) layer** — Activity Schema `am_<entity>_stream`; complements Kimball STAR over CORE (4 modeling techniques showcased). |
| D14 | **Delivery = walking skeleton first** — smallest full slice (1 source→raw→spec→SQLMesh→ML parquet→notebook+Evidence, Prefect+dlt), then replicate across toolsets; **run in Docker + Prefect after each** (`integrations/prefect/`). |
| D15 | **Commit + push after every successful run** (green gate / green pipeline). |
| D16 | **Pre-commit via prek** (fast) — lint ALL (Python·SQL·Bash·YAML) + smoke tests on commit, data tests on pre-push, gitleaks. |
| D17 | **Test tiers** smoke / unit / integration / **e2e = run Prefect job + assert results**. |
| D18 | **Root-lean**: configs→`config/`, tests→`src/tests/`, scripts→`src/scripts/`, CI→`.ci/`; `structure-validate` guard. |
| D19 | **`.ai/` symlinks** for plans/memory/skills (memory·skills gitignored; specs·scripts tracked). |
| D20 | _(deferred)_ upsert code + scaffold **standards into `~/.ai/skills/.settings/code_specs/`** later. |
| + | Complete alt setups **Prefect+Bruin** & **Prefect+Dagster-over-dlt/dbt**; **CDC via ingestr** from the Postgres landing (optional). |

Assumptions: fresh `git init` · OGAP kept as sibling · GitHub Actions primary CI · package `ogip`.

Open design note: D0 (author in Bruin) + D5 (run on SQLMesh) implies a spec-compiler step —
flagged for the user; alternative is authoring natively in SQLMesh.

## Next steps

Reprioritized 2026-07-17 — driver checklist in [TODO.md](TODO.md), map in
[docs/ROADMAP.md](../docs/ROADMAP.md):

1. **P1 — resilient scraping slice** (lane `ingestion`): async `ScraperSource` + landing +
   HLTB end to end, per [ADR-0014](../docs/adr/ADR-0014-resilient-scraping-concurrency.md)
   → [tasks/scraping-resilient.md](tasks/scraping-resilient.md).
2. **P1 — finalize R2 + VPS deploy** (lane `core-pipeline`): staged s3 items →
   `integrations/prefect/deploy.py` → real R2 bucket → host deploy + smoke
   → [tasks/r2-vps-finalize.md](tasks/r2-vps-finalize.md).
3. **P2** — groom [tasks/sources-backlog.md](tasks/sources-backlog.md); then M1–M4 toolset
   replication; broaden per Phases 4–10.
