# Airbyte + Terraform ingestion lane — design

- **Date:** 2026-07-23
- **Status:** design, awaiting approval
- **Lane:** `experimental/ingestion/airbyte` (off the production `make` path — AGENTS.md §30-32)
- **Refs:** OGIP#18, OGIP#19

## 1. Problem

`spec/sources/games/*.yaml` descriptors may carry an `airbyte:` block declaring that a source
should be ingested by Airbyte rather than dlt. Nothing consumes those blocks. This design turns
them into a running, Terraform-managed Airbyte deployment — and, in doing so, tests the claim the
blocks assert: *that a maintained connector beats hand-rolling dlt*.

## 2. Evidence that reshaped the design

All verified live against `https://connectors.airbyte.com/files/registries/v0/oss_registry.json`
(591 sources, 59 certified / 532 community) on 2026-07-20 and re-verified 2026-07-23.

**2.1 — Airbyte OSS no longer supports docker-compose.** The file was *removed* from
`airbytehq/airbyte-platform` by `refactor: remove docker compose configuration (#13544)` on
2024-08-23; the repo is actively developed (last push 2026-07-19), so there is no maintained-but-
frozen compose path. Supported self-host paths are `abctl` (kind + Helm inside Docker) and Helm on
a real cluster — **both end in Kubernetes**. The last shipped compose (`v0.63.14`) still runs but
freezes the platform at 08.2024, predating the `/api/public/v1` endpoint the current Terraform
provider targets.

**2.2 — The Terraform provider was rewritten.** v0.x had 278 per-connector resources
(`airbyte_source_reddit`, …). v1.x has **8 resources total**: every source is a generic
`airbyte_source` with a `definition_id` and a JSON `configuration` string. This is *better* for us
— one resource with `for_each` over a map derived from YAML is now natural, which was structurally
impossible before. Pin **1.2.0** (1.3.0 exists only as `-rc1`).

**2.3 — `source-twitch` does not exist.** Zero hits at any support level, and none in the old
278-resource provider either. The descriptor's `connector: source-twitch` was a fiction; it has
been corrected in the registry SSoT to an in-house declarative connector.

**2.4 — `source-reddit` is hollow.** `language: manifest-only`, `releaseStage: alpha`, v0.0.57,
community. *Manifest-only means the connector is itself just a declarative YAML* — there is no
engineering embedded in it that dlt's `rest_api` does not equally provide. The maintained-connector
argument is not weak here, it is empty.

**2.5 — The certified pool is structurally mismatched with OGIP.** Of 59 certified connectors,
nearly all extract from a SaaS account *you own* (Salesforce, Stripe, HubSpot, Zendesk, ad
platforms) or from your own database. OGIP ingests **public** market data. `source-github` is the
exception: GitHub's public data *is* the product. It is `language: python`,
`releaseStage: generally_available`, certified, v2.1.37.

## 3. Decisions

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Runtime = `abctl` | The only supported path yielding a platform the v1.x provider can talk to. Compose-v0.63 and k3s+Helm get tracked issues, not implementations. |
| D2 | Destination = own Postgres schema `airbyte_raw` | Same instance as the dlt landing (ADR-0006), separate schema — the experimental lane never writes into the production landing zone. |
| D3 | Three Terraform driver variants, one shared module | The comparison is the deliverable; a winner is chosen after they exist. |
| D4 | Provider pinned `airbytehq/airbyte` 1.2.0 | 1.3.0 is a release candidate. |
| D5 | `definition_id` is never stored in specs | Resolved live via the `airbyte_connector_configuration` data source. Same principle as `spec/sources/README.md:16-18` — a stored verdict rots into a lie, and so does a stored UUID. |
| D6 | Twitch ships as an in-house declarative connector | No registry connector exists; registered via `airbyte_declarative_source_definition`, so it stays fully Terraform-managed. |
| D7 | Isolation via **git worktree**, not a branch switch | See §8 — this checkout is shared by 4+ live sessions. |

## 4. The source set

Three sources, deliberately spanning the full quality range — which makes the lane a real test
rather than a demo:

| Source | Connector | Support | What it proves |
|---|---|---|---|
| `github_repos` | `airbyte/source-github` 2.1.37 | **certified**, Python CDK, GA | The genuine case — see §4.1. Domain fit: game-engine ecosystem activity (Godot/Bevy/O3DE + modding long tail) — engine is a literal input to the cost×scope×revenue models. |
| `reddit_posts` | `airbyte/source-reddit` 0.0.57 | community, manifest-only, alpha | The counter-example. Kept *because* it is weak: it demonstrates that "there is a connector" is not by itself an argument. |
| `twitch_streams` | in-house declarative manifest | n/a — we maintain it | The custom-connector path (`airbyte_declarative_source_definition`), and the honest admission that lane uniformity — not maintenance savings — is the only remaining benefit. |

### 4.1 Why `source-github` is the one that earns the lane

Verified against <https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/github> on 2026-07-23:

- **39 enumerated streams**, 26 of them incremental. (The page's own summary header says 53 —
  the enumeration and the header disagree; 39 is what is actually listed. Either number is an
  order of magnitude past what a hand-rolled client stays cheap at.)
- **Mixed REST + GraphQL.** The `releases` stream goes through GraphQL while most others are REST.
  Hand-rolling means implementing *two* API paradigms and their two pagination models.
- **Multi-token rotation** with client-side throttling: the connector rotates through several PATs
  and waits out rate limits (configurable, up to 240 min) rather than failing the sync.
- **Per-repo incremental state** across a repo list — N repos × M streams of cursor bookkeeping.
- **OSS caveat:** Open Source supports **PAT only**; OAuth is Cloud-only. Matches our
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` slot, so no design change — but it is not the same auth story as Cloud docs imply.

None of this is expressible in dlt's declarative `rest_api`; it would become a typed client we own
and maintain. That is the exact cost the `airbyte:` blocks claim to avoid, and here the claim holds.

## 5. Architecture

```
experimental/ingestion/airbyte/
  up.sh / down.sh                  abctl local install/uninstall; port from config SSoT
  credentials.sh                   abctl local credentials → AIRBYTE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET
  connectors/twitch/manifest.yaml  low-code declarative connector for Helix
  terraform/
    modules/airbyte-connection/    airbyte_source + airbyte_connection (+ one shared destination)
    variant-a-yamldecode/          fileset() + yamldecode() over spec/ — zero generation
    variant-b-codegen-tf/          generated .tf, committed
    variant-c-codegen-tfvars/      generated .tfvars.json + hand-written HCL
  README.md                        the three-variant comparison
```

Only *how config reaches the module* differs between variants; the resource definitions are shared.
Otherwise the comparison is dishonest and the HCL triplicates.

**Auth.** OSS uses client credentials with a **15-minute** token TTL, so the provider gets
`client_id`/`client_secret`/`token_url` — never a static `bearer_auth`, which can expire mid-apply.

**State.** Local file under `.run/`. This is an experimental lane; a remote backend is unwarranted.

**Layer naming** (AGENTS.md hard rule 1): `github__repos`, `reddit__posts`, `twitch__streams` in
`airbyte_raw`.

**Config SSoT.** `config/config.yml` gains `services.airbyte_port` and `postgres.airbyte_schema`;
values reach the stack through the rendered `.env` (`make render-env`). No literals in scripts.

## 6. Scripts, gates, skill

Scripts land in the **existing** `~/.ai/skills/_scripts/de/ingestion/` submodule beside
`route_tool.py` (which already assigns the `airbyte` route) — not a new domain.

- `emit_airbyte_tf.py` — validates `airbyte:` blocks (connector exists in the live registry ·
  `incremental` ⇒ `cursor` present · `streams` non-empty) and renders artifacts for variants B/C.
- `src/scripts/airbyte-drift.sh` — drift gate, modelled on `sources-registry-check.sh`.
- Root `Justfile` passthroughs in the `sources-*` style (`Justfile:177-188`): `airbyte-up`,
  `airbyte-tf-validate`, `airbyte-tf-plan`, `airbyte-apply`, `airbyte-drift`.
- `.ci/steps/airbyte-tf.sh` + a pre-commit hook firing only when `spec/` or `terraform/` is touched.
- Skill `/add-airbyte-sync`, created via `/create-skill`; all deterministic steps behind the
  Justfile per `/save-all-deterministic-for-skill-as-scripts`.

## 7. What CI can and cannot verify

An earlier statement in this design's discussion promised `terraform plan` in CI. **That was
wrong** and is corrected here: `plan` requires a reachable Airbyte API, so it cannot run
credential-free in CI.

| Gate | Runs | Verifies |
|---|---|---|
| CI (every PR) | `terraform fmt -check`, `terraform validate`, `airbyte-drift` | HCL is well-formed; generated artifacts match `spec/`; `airbyte:` blocks are internally valid |
| Local, opt-in | `airbyte-tf-plan`, `airbyte-apply`, real sync | Connector definitions resolve; credentials work; data actually lands |

The local path skips cleanly when credentials are absent — it never fails as if broken.

## 8. Isolation — worktree, not branch switch

This checkout is shared by 4+ live agent sessions committing to `dev` (session start reported 28
live agent processes and a held repo lock). `git checkout -b` would move the working tree **for
every one of them**. So: a dedicated **git worktree** plus an `obj--airbyte` lane lock. Subtree is
not used — the Terraform reads `spec/sources/games/*.yaml` from above its own prefix, so a vendored
subtree would not be self-contained, and closing that gap would mean a second projection layer on
top of the registry→`spec/` one that already exists.

## 9. Risks

- **The lane's premise survives on one source.** Strip `github_repos` and no remaining source
  justifies Airbyte over dlt. That is a finding worth stating plainly in the README, not hiding.
- **Variant B is expected to lose.** Generated `.tf` in git reproduces exactly the drift class the
  registry→`spec/` projection already suffers. It is still built, because a predicted result is not
  a measured one — but the prediction is on record.
- **`abctl` runs Kubernetes-in-Docker.** Heavier than the rest of the compose-based stack, and it
  does not join the `ogip` network the way `deploy/obs/` does. Disk and memory cost is real.
- **`source-github` rate limits.** Keyless is 60 req/hr (measured); a real sync needs
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` for 5,000/hr.

## 10. Out of scope

Publishing any of this data (all three sources are `publishable: false`); promoting Airbyte to the
default `make` path; staging/core models over `airbyte_raw`; a remote Terraform backend.
